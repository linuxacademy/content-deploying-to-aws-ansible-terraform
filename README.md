# Deploying to AWS with Terraform and Ansible Repo

This repo will contain code used and taught in the A Cloud Guru course named above.

This course was originally created before Terrafom 0.13 was released however I have updated it to work with version 0.13 in the `terraform_v13_compatible_code` folder.


------

For following along using Terraform 0.12 refer to the `aws_la_cloudplayground_multiple_workers_version`.

Again, for following along using Terraform 0.13 refer to the `terraform_v13_compatible_code`.

Although the folder naming convention in this repository should make sense for the most part, it was primarily created to be referred through the lessons on the A Cloud Guru website.


For queries and feedback please reach out to ACG support: https://help.acloud.guru

## Warning
1. Parts of this repository expect users to obtain a Route53 domain name, which is available with ACG Playground tier subscription.
2. Following along and deploying resources in AWS as taught by this course WILL incur charges!!! Be sure to destroy any infrastructure that you do not need.
